This is the repository for the web developpment project.

To see the webpage, you can for instance open a terminal, change directory into the directory of the project, then, assuming you have python installed on your machine, you can launch a local web server with
```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then, you can just open up the webpage in your web browser by typing `http://localhost:8000/html/home.html` in the url bar
