        <p>Everything starts in 1985. Steve Jobs leaves Apple and founds NeXT, the company destined to shape the future of Apple's
             operating systems. At NeXT, Jobs and his team create NeXTSTEP, a Unix-like operating system that makes its debut in 1989.
              NeXTSTEP is built on the Mach kernel, which hails from Carnegie Mellon University, and incorporates components from
               FreeBSD and other BSD operating systems. Its sophisticated, object-oriented graphical user interface is designed using
                the Objective-C programming language.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, throughout the 1990s, Apple is on a quest to develop a "next-generation" OS to replace its classic Mac OS. 
            Despite ambitious projects like Taligent, Copland, and Gershwin, each one ends in abandonment. This predicament leads Apple
             to acquire NeXT in 1997, with NeXTSTEP, later known as OPENSTEP, providing the foundation for Apple's new OS. 
             This acquisition also brings Steve Jobs back to Apple as interim, and soon after, permanent CEO.</p>
        <p>Under Steve Jobs's leadership, OPENSTEP transforms from a programmer-friendly system into a user-friendly platform tailored
             for home users and creative professionals. Initially codenamed "Rhapsody," this project eventually emerges as Mac OS X
             , marking the beginning of a new era.</p>
        <p>Here comes <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.0">Cheetah</a>, Mac OS 10.0, released on the march 24, 2001. The
             first genuine apple's Operating System.</p>

        <p>Now, we talked about MacOS, let's discuss a little bit about its creator, Apple. And the first question that might come to
             your mind is, why an apple? Indeed, a cheetah is impressive, strong, and fast. However, an apple has none of these 
             qualities. To understand this decision, we have to go back to 1976. The founders of Apple Computer, Steve Jobs, 
             Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, chose a logo showing Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree, reading a book. 
             This image symbolized the connection between science and technology, highlighting the innovative spirit of the company.
        </p>
        <p>It was in 1977 that designer Rob Janoff created the version that would become the emblematic Apple logo: the rainbow apple.
             The reason for choosing the rainbow colors remains unclear; some suggest it was a nod to the LGBTQIA+ community, 
             while others believe it simply reflected Apple's desire to stand out from other companies of the era. Interestingly,
              there is also speculation that the bitten apple pays homage to Alan Turing, the father of computer science, whose tragic 
              death involved a cyanide-laced apple.
        </p>
        <p>In 1998, when Steve Jobs returned to lead Apple after several years away, he decided to radically simplify the logo.
             The multicolored apple was replaced by a monochrome version, which evolved over the years from black to chrome and then
              to white. This new, minimalist version helped solidify the logo's recognition and made it more easily adaptable across 
              all media.</p>
