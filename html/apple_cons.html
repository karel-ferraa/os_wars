        <h1 id="title">Why does so many people don't like macOS ?</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Hardware Limitations:</strong> macOS is made by Apple and for Apple. If you like this operating
                    system, you will have to use an Apple computer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> As you have to buy a Mac to use macOS, considering the prices of Apple's
                    products, it is probably one of the most expensive OS to get. However, once you have bought
                    your device, Apple offers the new version of its OS to its users each year, for free.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Software Compatibility:</strong> As macOS is less popular than Windows, some software is not compatible
                    with it. It can be really annoying, especially for students in scientific studies. Many 
                    software applications required in the scientific domain are not supported by the OS, especially since Apple changed
                    their Intel processors to Apple silicon. Nevertheless, if you love macOS, you can still use 
                    a virtual machine to run this kind of incompatible software.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Not Gamer Friendly:</strong> Even though macOS has improved in the last few years, it is still not well designed 
                    to run games.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Customization Limitations:</strong> macOS offers fewer customization options compared to some other operating
                    systems like Linux. While macOS provides a polished user experience out of the box, users who prefer
                    extensive customization may find it limiting.</p>
