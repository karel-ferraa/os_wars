        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Ressource fragmentation:</strong> The strength of this operating system is also one of it's weaknesses. Because there are so many different distributions, and because there are so many forks, developper ressources are stretched across projects that seek to achieve the same goals. The great number of distributions can also be confusing for new adopters.

            </li>
            <li>
		    <p><strong>GNU/Linux can be confusing:</strong> There are often many different ways to achieve the same result on GNU/Linux, be it using shell scripting, using a specific program, or using a graphical interface. Users might not understand the differences between these methods, and can get annoyed when something as simple as installing some software confronts you with the terms 'package manager', 'install script', 'Flatpak', 'AppImage', 'Snap' and 'Docker'. Also, the command line can be scary for non-programmers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
		    <p><strong>User adoption:</strong> Because there are less users of GNU/Linux than Windows or MacOS users, some software developpers choose not to support this operating system. This is felt mostly with video games (although support has improved with Proton and Steam helping), and some closed-source hardware vendors, see the next point.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
		    <p><strong>Support for closed-source hardware:</strong>Although this is not really a problem with GNU/Linux, but rather with the hardware manufacturers that refuse to support GNU/Linux, compatibility with some hardware may be problematic. For instance, relations with <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPh-5P4XH6o>NVIDIA</a> have historically been ... a bit tense.</p>
