        <h1 id="title">What makes macOS a great Operating System ?</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>User Experience:</strong> macOS is well known for its elegant and clean design. Indeed, it offers a 
            great user experience where everything is smooth and fast.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Security:</strong> macOS has traditionally been seen as a secure operating system, partly because
                it has fewer users compared to Linux or Windows, which implies less attacks. However, as macOS grows in popularity, it is increasingly exposed to attacks.
                That's why Apple has developed new built-in protections against malware and viruses, and 
                regular updates help keep the system secure. Features like Gatekeeper and XProtect add
                additional layers of security, making it still a reliable choice for users concerned 
                about their privacy and data protection.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Integration with Apple Ecosystem:</strong> One of the biggest advantages of macOS is its seamless integration 
                with other Apple products. Whether it's using Handoff to continue tasks across devices, iCloud for 
                effortless file synchronization, or AirDrop for quick file sharing, macOS works harmoniously with iPhones, 
                iPads, and other Apple devices to create a cohesive and efficient user experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Great for Artists:</strong> macOS is favored by many artists and creative professionals. The operating system 
                supports a wide range of creative software, including industry standards like Adobe Creative Cloud, Final Cut Pro, 
                and Logic Pro. The Retina display on Mac computers also provides exceptional color accuracy and clarity, 
                which is essential for graphic design, video editing, and other artistic endeavors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Upgradability of the OS:</strong> Apple consistently provides free upgrades to the latest version of macOS, 
                ensuring that users have access to the newest features and security enhancements without additional cost. 
                This commitment to providing regular updates helps keep devices current and improves their longevity, 
                making macOS a cost-effective choice in the long run.</p>
