            The following section took information from <a href="https://www.phonandroid.com/windows-a-30-ans-retour-sur-le-symbole-de-linformatique-grand-public.html">phonandroid</a> and

        <p>The history of Windows is a fascinating adventure that begins in the early 1980s with a clear vision from two young entrepreneurs, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, the founders of Microsoft. Their ambition was to create a graphical operating system that would make personal computers more intuitive and accessible to the general public.</p>
        <p>At that time, personal computers were dominated by text-based systems like MS-DOS, which required specific technical knowledge. Gates and Allen, visionaries at heart, saw the immense potential of a graphical interface that would allow users to point and click instead of typing complex commands.</p>
        <p>In 1983, Microsoft announced the development of Windows, a graphical environment for MS-DOS. After two years of intense work, Windows 1.0 was launched in November 1985. This system offered basic features such as overlapping windows, icons, and drop-down menus, making it easier for users to navigate. Although rudimentary by today's standards, Windows 1.0 was a revolution at the time, laying the foundation for a user-friendly graphical interface.</p>
        <p>The true breakthrough for Windows came with the release of Windows 3.0 in 1990. This version benefited from a much more refined interface, better performance, and improved memory management. Windows 3.0 met with resounding commercial success, cementing Microsoft's position as a major player in the software market.</p>
        <p>But it was with Windows 95, launched in August 1995, that Microsoft truly transformed the computing landscape. Windows 95 introduced major innovations such as the Start menu, the taskbar, and an integrated user interface with better Internet support. This version marked the entry of personal computers into the modern era, making computing accessible and intuitive for millions of people around the world.</p>
        <p>Bill Gates, in particular, became the face of this revolution, embodying the spirit of innovation and Microsoft's determination to change how people interact with technology. His vision of a computer on every desk and in every home guided the development of Windows, helping to make this platform one of the most influential in the history of computing.</p>
        <p>In the following years, iconic versions such as Windows XP, Windows 7, and more recently Windows 10 and Windows 11 emerged, each bringing its share of innovations and refinements. Today, Windows remains at the heart of our daily interaction with technology, a lasting testament to the vision and ingenuity of its original creators.</p>
