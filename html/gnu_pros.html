        <h1 id="title">What makes GNU a great Operating System ?</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Freedom:</strong> GNU is one of the only operating systems that guarantees the freedoms of it's users. There are other operating systems whose code is licensed under a free software license, such as for instance the BSD family of operating systems, however these operating systems do not use a copyleft license, and they aren't as developped/popular.
		</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Price:</strong> GNU is gratis! If schools and public administrations used GNU, they would save a lot of money. This also makes GNU suited for us indebted EFREI students. With GNU, you won't have to worry about paying license fees just to be able to use a computer! Additionally, GNU can run on low-end systems, so you can use it on a cheap computer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
		    <p><strong>Security:</strong>GNU is the only system that can provide real security to it's users, that is security not only against outside attackers, but also security against the <em>developpers of the system</em>. Because the code for the GNU system is open, anyone can check that there are no malicious features, backdoors or vulnerabilities. This also ties into the  next point. Although GNU has a higher level of security by default compared to other operating systems, but if the user needs more, then they can opt for a security-oriented distribution and they can also modify the components of the system to suit their needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Variety of choice:</strong> As we joked about in the landing page, GNU offers you a lot of choice. Whilst this may be confusing for beginners who have never even heard of the concept of distros, this soon becomes a real boon once you become more familiar with the system. Chances are, there is a distribution that fits your needs. Advanced users can choose a minimal distribution and create an entirely customized environment for maximal productivity. For instance, Karel uses a custom keyboard layout (modified programmer dvorak) and uses vim keybindings almost everywhere, such that he rarely needs to touch the mouse!.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Extensibility:</strong> GNU mostly follows the Unix philosophy, that is: each program should do one thing and do it well. This makes it so that it is easy to extend the functionality of the system because you don't have to break the whole thing to change just one part. GNU lets you look at and modify it's internals, and once you learn the basics of bash, it's very easy to open up a terminal and start automating things with shell scripts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Unlike Windows, GNU does not constantly increase it's hardware requirements, forcing you to change computer if you want to keep using the latest version of the operating system. As we have said in the price section, GNU can run perfectly fine on old laptops, and the lifespan of hardware is the factor with the highest impact on hardware's ecological footprint. Want to save the planet? Instead of buying a new device, install GNU on your old computer or buy an old, used computer and install GNU on it!</p>
